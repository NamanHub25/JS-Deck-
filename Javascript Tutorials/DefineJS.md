# Javascript 
JavaScript is the programming language of the web and we can add functionalities like calculating, manipulating ad=nd validating of data  

It can update or change HTML and CSS as well

Likewise other programming languages we don't directly code JS on our VS Code (we can but that's a differnt thing) instead, we run our JS programs on the console window of any browser 

As I said we can run our JS codes directly in the VS Code's or any other IDE's terminal, yes it is possible by setting up the environment for NodeJS 

## What is NodeJS ?
Node JS is a server side programming language used for backend development and alongside provides us the enviroment for running JS locally on our machines 

## How to access console window 
Open Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) --> Right click --> Go to Inspect option --> Select console from the inspect window

After accessing our console whatever we write is our JS only because most of the console's window was coded in JS only

Console works on the concept of REPL:-
R -> Read (Reads whatever we write)
E -> Evaluate (If we have given any sort of calculation then it evalutes it)
P -> Print (Returns the desired output)
L -> Loop (Repeats the same)

## How to link JS file to our HTML file

We link our JS file with the HTML file using the sript tag:

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

## How to print the JS code likewise other programming languages ?
We use console.log method from the console object 
 
# Hello Duniya! program in JS 

```js
console.log("Hello! duniya"); // Our main reason to use console.log() is that whenever we want that whatever we write on our code editor should gets print on the brwoser's console, so this method helps to link the browser to our code editor 
```

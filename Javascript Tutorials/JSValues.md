# JavaScript Values
Javascript has two types of values:- 
- Literals -> These are fixed values 
- Variables -> Variable values i.e. they vary 

## JavaScript Literals 
The most important syntax to write literals are:-
- Numbers are written with or without decimal

``` js 
10.50
1001
```

- Strings are text written in double or single quotes

``` js
"Naman Mehrotra"
'Come on! Chiks'
```

# Javascript Variables
Variables in JS are named containers to store data 

## How do we declare variables in JS 
 
| Modern JS       | Older JS        |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `let`           | `var`          |
| `const`         | Automatically  |
